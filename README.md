## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

> This app creates a website that allows the user to reserve a room or a venue to host an event. The userâ€™s will be able to see what the space may include like a basketball court, ping pong tables, table and chairs, or whatever the space includes. Then the user will be able to see a calendar showing the rooms or venues and what times are available to be reserved. If a time is booked and it is a public event it will show what event is going on at that time. If its not a public event it will show that it is booked for a private event. The site will require all users to sign up to be able to reserve a room. We are using Heroku to host the website and using JawsDB for the database.
